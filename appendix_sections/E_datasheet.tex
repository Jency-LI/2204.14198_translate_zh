    \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Motivation}} 
    \vspace{2mm}\\
    \toprule
    For what purpose was the dataset created? Who created the dataset? Who funded the creation of the dataset? &
    The dataset was created for pre-training vision-language models and was created by researchers and engineers. \\ %
    \midrule
    Any other comments? & 
    None.

    \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Composition}}
    \vspace{2mm}\\
    \toprule
    What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? &
    All instances of the dataset are documents from the web containing interleaved text and images. \\
    \midrule
    How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)? &
    There are 43.3M instances (documents) in total, with a total of 185M images and 182 GB of text. \\
    \midrule
    Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? &
    The dataset is a sample from a larger set.\\
    \midrule
    What data does each instance consist of? &
    Each instance is made up of a sequence of UTF-8 bytes encoding the document’s text, as well as a sequence of integers indicating the positions of images in the text, and the images themselves in compressed format (see Section \maintoappref{sec:interleaved_datasets}). \\
    \midrule
    Is there a label or target associated with each instance? &
    No, there are no labels associated with each instance. \\
    \midrule
    Is any information missing from individual instances?  &
    No. \\
    \midrule
    Are relationships between individual instances made explicit? &
    There are no relationships between the different instances in the dataset. \\
    \midrule
    Are there recommended data splits? &
    We use random splits for the training and development sets.\\
    \midrule
    Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? &
    There is significant redundancy at the sub-document level.\\
    \midrule
    Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources? &
    The dataset is self-contained. \\
    \midrule
    Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential? &
    No. \\
    \midrule
    Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? &
    The dataset likely contains some data that might be considered offensive, insulting or threatening, as such data is prevalent on the web. We do not try to filter out such content, with the exception of explicit content, which we identify using dedicated filter.

    \noalign{\vskip 2mm}
    \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Collection Process}}
    \vspace{2mm}\\
    \toprule
    How was the data associated with each instance acquired? &
    The data is available publicly on the web. \\
    \midrule
    What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data? &
    The data was collected using a variety of software programs to extract and clean the raw text and images. \\
    \midrule
    If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy? &
    We randomly subsample documents. \\
    \midrule
    Over what timeframe was the data collected? &
    The dataset was collected over a period of several months in 2021. We do not filter the sources based on creation date. \\
    \midrule
    Were any ethical review processes conducted? &
    No.

    \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Preprocessing/cleaning/labeling}}
    \vspace{2mm}\\
    \toprule
    Was any preprocessing/Cleaning/Labeling of the data done (e.g., discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances, processing of missing values)? &
    Yes — the pre-processing details are discussed in Appendix~\ref{app:collection-m3w}.  \\
    \midrule
    Is the software used to preprocess/clean/label the instances available? &
    No. 
    \vspace{1mm} \\

    \noalign{\vskip 2mm}
    \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Uses}}
    \vspace{2mm}\\
    \toprule
    Has the dataset been used for any tasks already? &
    Yes, we use the dataset for pre-training multimodal language and vision models. \\
    \midrule
    Is there a repository that links to any or all papers or systems that use the dataset? &
    No, the dataset has only been used to train the models in this paper. \\
    \midrule
    What (other) tasks could the dataset be used for? &
    We do not foresee other usages of the dataset at this stage. \\
    \midrule
    Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might impact future uses? &
    The dataset is static and thus will become progressively more ``stale’’. For example, it will not reflect new language and norms that evolve over time. However, due to the nature of the dataset it is relatively cheap to collect an up-to-date version. \\
    \midrule
    Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? &
    The dataset described in this paper contains English language text almost exclusively and therefore should not be used for training models intended to have multilingual capabilities. \\
