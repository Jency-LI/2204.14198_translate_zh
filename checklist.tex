\section*{Checklist}




\begin{enumerate}


\item For all authors...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope?
    \answerYes{}
  \item Did you describe the limitations of your work?
    \answerYes{See Section~\ref{sec:discussion}.}
  \item Did you discuss any potential negative societal impacts of your work?
    \answerYes{See Section~\ref{sec:discussion} for a brief discussion and Appendix~\maintoappref{sec:broader_impact} for the full discussion.}
  \item Have you read the ethics review guidelines and ensured that your paper conforms to them?
    \answerYes{}
\end{enumerate}


\item If you are including theoretical results...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Did you state the full set of assumptions of all theoretical results?
    \answerNA{}
        \item Did you include complete proofs of all theoretical results?
    \answerNA{}
\end{enumerate}


\item If you ran experiments...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Did you include the code, data, and instructions needed to reproduce the main experimental results (either in the supplemental material or as a URL)?
    \answerNo{The code and the data are proprietary.}
  \item Did you specify all the training details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen)?
    \answerYes{See Section~\ref{sec:experiments} and Appendix~\maintoappref{app:extra_experiments_results}.}
        \item Did you report error bars (e.g., with respect to the random seed after running experiments multiple times)?
    \answerNo{We do not observe large enough variance in our training runs to justify the computation cost incurred by multiple training runs. For the largest models, it is not feasible within our compute budget.}
        \item Did you include the total amount of compute and the type of resources used (e.g., type of GPUs, internal cluster, or cloud provider)?
    \answerYes{Details can be found in Appendix~\maintoappref{app:large_scale_training}. In short, our largest run was trained on 1536 TPU chips for 15 days.}
\end{enumerate}


\item If you are using existing assets (e.g., code, data, models) or curating/releasing new assets...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item If your work uses existing assets, did you cite the creators? \answerYes{We properly cited the prior methods on which our work is based, as well as prior datasets when appropriate (e.g., ALIGN).}
  \item Did you mention the license of the assets? \answerNA{The assets we used are previous work for which we cited papers. We do mention the license of all visual assets we use for the figures of the paper in Appendix~\maintoappref{app:visual_content_credit}.}
  \item Did you include any new assets either in the supplemental material or as a URL?
    \answerNo{}
  \item Did you discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose data you're using/curating?
    \answerYes{Our data was automatically scraped from million of webpages. See Datasheets~\cite{datasheet} in Appendix~\maintoappref{datasheets}.}
  \item Did you discuss whether the data you are using/curating contains personally identifiable information or offensive content?
    \answerYes{See Datasheets~\cite{datasheet} in Appendix~\maintoappref{datasheets}}.
\end{enumerate}


\item If you used crowdsourcing or conducted research with human subjects...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Did you include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable?
    \answerNA{}
  \item Did you describe any potential participant risks, with links to Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals, if applicable?
    \answerNA{}
  \item Did you include the estimated hourly wage paid to participants and the total amount spent on participant compensation?
    \answerNA{}
\end{enumerate}
